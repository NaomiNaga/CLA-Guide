# CLA-Guide
Guide I made to study and pass the LabVIEW Architect Certification (CLA) - 2019

My mentor Filipe Palma had passed certification a few years before and based on the main points he taught me, I developed this guide. I practiced to the point where I memorized how to create the initial models. Only after creating the foundations do I face the problem presented in the test. I don't think it's foolproof, but if I need to do it again, this is what I'll keep using as a base.

Following the guide, the CLA_Template should be the entire hierarchy built. Documentation should be done last to be specific to the certification test, I believe that leaving it too generic could harm the final assessment.

I took this test in 2019 in Brazil, I was 26 years old and had 7 years of experience using LabVIEW daily. I had already taken the Core 1, 2 and 3 courses - they are not mandatory, but they formalize knowledge. The test is long and required good time control to cover all the points.

Recertification can be done by recycling knowledge on the NI website, which is what I did, so I am not aware of any subsequent changes.


I am not responsible for anyone's actions, I am just providing what I did and practiced to pass the certification test, it may or may not work for others.
